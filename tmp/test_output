  q   difference of lift quotient to 1                (+)
  v   conviction (inverse lift for negated head)      (+)
  e   absolute difference of conviction to 1          (+)
  r   difference of conviction quotient to 1          (+)
  k   conditional probability ratio                   (+)
  j   importance (binary log. of cond. prob. ratio)   (+)
  z   certainty factor (relative confidence change)   (+)
  n   normalized chi^2 measure                        (+)
  p   p-value from (unnormalized) chi^2 measure       (-)
  y   normalized chi^2 measure with Yates' correction (+)
  t   p-value from Yates-corrected chi^2 measure      (-)
  i   information difference to prior                 (+)
  g   p-value from G statistic/information difference (-)
  f   Fisher's exact test (table probability)         (-)
  h   Fisher's exact test (chi^2 measure)             (-)
  m   Fisher's exact test (information gain)          (-)
  s   Fisher's exact test (support)                   (-)
All measures for association rules are also applicable
to item sets and are then aggregated over all possible
association rules with a single item in the consequent.
The aggregation mode can be set with the option -a#.
Measures marked with (+) must meet or exceed the threshold,
measures marked with (-) must not exceed the threshold
in order for the rule or item set to be reported.

evaluation measure aggregation modes (option -a#)
  x   no aggregation (use first value)
  m   minimum of individual measure values
  n   maximum of individual measure values
  a   average of individual measure values

eclat algorithm variants (option -A#)
  a   automatic choice based on data properties (default)
  e   transaction id lists intersection (basic)
  i   transaction id lists intersection (improved)
  b   transaction id lists represented as bit vectors
  t   filtering with item occurrence table (standard)
  s   filtering with item occurrence table (simplified)
  r   transaction id range lists intersection
  o   occurrence deliver from transaction lists (default)
  d   transaction id difference sets (diffsets/dEclat)
With algorithm variant 'o' closed or maximal item sets can
only be found with extensions checks. Hence option -y0 is
automatically added to options -tc or -tm if -Ao is given.
Rules as the target type or using a rule-based evaluation
measure enforce algorithm variant 'o'.

information output format characters (option -v#)
  %%  a percent sign
  %i  number of items (item set size)
  %a  absolute item set  support
  %s  relative item set  support as a fraction
  %S  relative item set  support as a percentage
  %b  absolute body set  support
  %x  relative body set  support as a fraction
  %X  relative body set  support as a percentage
  %h  absolute head item support
  %y  relative head item support as a fraction
  %Y  relative head item support as a percentage
  %c  rule confidence as a fraction
  %C  rule confidence as a percentage
  %l  lift value of a rule (confidence/prior)
  %L  lift value of a rule as a percentage
  %e  additional evaluation measure
  %E  additional evaluation measure as a percentage
All format characters can be preceded by the number
of significant digits to be printed (at most 32 digits),
even though this value is ignored for integer numbers.
